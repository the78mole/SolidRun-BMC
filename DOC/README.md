# Documentation on the Honeycomb, ClearFog and the COM

The Honeycomb and ClearFog are mostly identical as they both use the same COM module, but they differ slightly in the peripherals mounted on the board. The ClearFog e.g. has a QSFP28 socket mounted, while the Honeycomb "only" has it's four SFP+ slots.

In this folder you can find a simplified schematic of the COM and the schematics of the Honeycomb and ClearFog carrier boards.

More information about these servers and their components can be found on the official SolidRun website.
